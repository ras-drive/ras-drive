I'm a trans girl who enjoys coding in their free time along with music and video games. Among some of my favorite bands are Red Hot Chili Peppers, System Of A Down, Busta Rhymes, Old Dirty Bastard, and Kendrick Lamar. Some of my favorite games are the Fallout series, the Borderlands series, the Dark Souls series, Elden Ring, Alien: Isolation, and Driving Simulation Games. I've been seriously coding since 2018 (Interested but only minorly studying since 2013) and am probably thinking about going into the automotive electronics field. I'm also passionate about Linux and other free software.
