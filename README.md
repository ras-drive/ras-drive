I'm a trans girl who enjoys coding in their free time along with music and video games. Among some of my favorite bands are Red Hot Chili Peppers, System Of A Down, The Black Dahliia Murder, Rush, and Pink Floyd. Some of my favorite games are the Fallout series, the Borderlands series, the Dark Souls series, The Long Dark, Alien: Isolation, and Celeste. I've been seriously coding since 2019 (Interested but only minorly studying since 2013) and am enrolled in a Computer Information Systems Degree program. I'm also passionate about Linux and other free software.
